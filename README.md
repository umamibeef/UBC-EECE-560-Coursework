# UBC EECE 560 Coursework

Assignments for the EECE 560 class.

## About This Repo

This is my coursework for the EECE 560 class, taken the second term of winter 2020. I make no guarantees for the accuracy of the solutions, so please keep that in mind when reviewing the work. The rendered PDFs as well as the original LaTeX of the assignments are present. Python was the main language used for the assignment solutions as well as PSCAD, but the PSCAD files were not included in this repository. There is also a few MATLAB files scattered throughout.
